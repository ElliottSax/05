Summary of Analysis

Purpose

We analyzed rideshare trips in terms of number of trips, number of drivers and total fares, with trends over the year in respect to the type of city; rural, urban, or suburban. By identifying differences in the data by city type we can understand the factors that impact ridesharing trends which may be useful in decision making by providing suggestions.

Findings

Total Rides by City Type

The total rides are broken down as follows:
Rural        125
Suburban     625
Urban       1625

The majority of the rides were in urban cities, making up roughly 68 percent of total rides. Suburban cities were in the middle, making up roughly 27 percent of total rides. Rural cities made up the least amount of total rides with roughly 5 percent of total rides.

Total Drivers by City Type

The total drivers are broken down as follows:
Rural         78
Suburban     490
Urban       2405

Roughly 81 percent of all drivers were in urban cities. About 16 percent of drivers were in suburban cities. Less than three percent of drivers were in rural areas. It may be worth noting that these numbers are similiar to the total rides by city, though they are even more skewed towards urban cities.

Total Fares by City

The total fares are broken down as follows:
Rural        4327.93
Suburban    19356.33
Urban       39854.38

Roughly 63 percent of total fares were in urban cities. Roughly 30 percent were in suburban cities. Roughly 7 percent of fares were in rural cities. It is noticable that urban cities make up slighly less total fares than the total rides, suburban slightly more, and rural farely more in terms of its percentage.

Average Fare per Ride by City

Fares were on average roughly $24.50 in urban cities, $31 in suburban and $34 in rural. We notice that despite the large difference in the other metrics, the average fares are similiar. We also notice that they are in the reverse order, with the highest being in rural areas, suburban again being in the middle and urban cities having the lowest average fair.

Average Fares per Driver

The average fare for an urban driver was $16.57. The average for a suburban driver was $39.50. The average for a rural driver was 55.49. We see that these number are again the reverse of the previous data. Rural fairs are significantly higher than urban fares and modestly higher than suburban fares.

Fares over time

We see total urban and suburban fares increase in the begining of January and rural fares decrease. Urban fares steadily increase until late February, suburban fares dip slightly during the same timeframe. Each city type reaches a peak in late February. Rural city fares peak again in the begining of April and trail off, as do urban fares. Suburban fares see an increase starting early April, where rural and urban trail off.

Recommendations

Perhaps the most striking trend is that rural cities account for much fewer rides, but much higher fares per driver. We could infer two things, this is because of fewer people needing rides and also riders choose not to use rideshare because of the higher cost. Rural cities seem to be underserved, urban areas seem to be overserved. 
It may be worth considering focusing on rural areas. Although an increase in drivers could bring the total fares down, as previously mentioned, it could persuade more riders to use rideshare with a lower price point.
It may also be worth noticing the peak across all city types in late February, this could be a time when it may be a time to have more drivers. This may have the benefit of leveling out fare amounts for riders and an increase in fares for drivers, considering drivers may have been unable to take all riders during this time because of rider volume.
Similarly, the begining of January sees low total fares and the begining of March sees another dip. The reverse of the previous recommendation may be worth considering and have fewer drivers during the lower timeframes. We could further extend this by increasing and decreasing drivers by city type, knowing trends for each, moving drivers to another city type when rides are expected to peak in another and dip in their current city type.
